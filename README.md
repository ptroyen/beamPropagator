# beamPropagator
Propagates the given profile of laser beam in the optical axis.

### Use Clean Propagator
Specify the profile and parameters of the laser beam to propagate, a flat-top profile is given as an example.
Two methods of propagation, one which works best for small distance propagation "TF" and another for long distance propagation "IR" is implemented. The code automatically selects which to choose based on critical sampling parameter.
